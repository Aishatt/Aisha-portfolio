                                     For many people, a car is one of the biggest assets they own. It provides comfort or luxury and the convenience of getting you from point A to B. It holds a resale value and may serve as a source of primary or secondary income or in other cases, It may serve the purpose of a collateral depedning on the circumstances.

                                <p>
                                    Auto insurance is an insurance policy where the insurer (insurance company) protects the car of the insured (you) in the event of an accident, theft, loss, or damage. This protection is valid upon paying an agreed annual premium according to what is outlined in your policy. 
                                    Accidents happen. Your car can be stolen, vandalized, or damaged by acts of nature. Auto insurance takes the headache off you and ensures you don't have to bear the sudden financial loss. It is one of the basic personal insurance you need.

                            Findings from our deeper insights reveal why car owners have so much
                            resentment towards car insurance. Auto insurers do not want to pay claims
                            in any form. When they do, the process is too stressful and not worth it.
                            Car owners accuse insurance companies of including hidden clauses
                            in their contracts that make resolving claims nearly impossible.<br><br>
                            Most car owners believe that they do not need any form of car insurance,
                            that their driving skills and religious beliefs are enough to protect them.
